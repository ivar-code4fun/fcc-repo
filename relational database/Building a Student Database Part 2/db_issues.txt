EXAMPLES
       To start postgres in the background using default values, type:

           $ nohup postgres >logfile 2>&1 </dev/null &

       To start postgres with a specific port, e.g., 1234:

           $ postgres -p 1234

	or set the environment variable PGPORT:

           $ export PGPORT=1234
           $ psql

       Named run-time parameters can be set in either of these styles:

           $ postgres -c work_mem=1234
           $ postgres --work-mem=1234

       Either form overrides whatever setting might exist for work_mem in postgresql.conf. Notice that underscores in parameter names can be written as either underscore or 	dash on the command line. Except for short-term
       experiments, it's probably better practice to edit the setting in postgresql.conf than to rely on a command-line switch to set a parameter.
